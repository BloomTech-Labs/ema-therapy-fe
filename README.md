## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Avyrxfpo/ema-therapy-app)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/MoodBloom-8c3de7cf08fc4e96a1014b9dd02cc1a3)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/CXt8kzVr1fvhPdWsQdSmok/Labs18_Ema-Therapy%2C-Hermione-Gogou%2CJanessa-Maisonet?node-id=201%3A339)

### MoodBloom

People seeking therapy don't have a single source of truth for tracking their moods or for sharing it with their mental health provider. Due to the limitations that come with HIPAA as well as limited time for mental health providers to change their work flow, MoodBloom provides a central location for users who want to improve their overall quality of life through mood.

Users can use MoodBloom to track their mood implementing EMA strategies for their own mindfulness or to share with their mental health provider.

### Key Features

- Progressive Web App
- Mood tracking system
- Daily tasks to keep you on track
- Data visualizations (graphs, calendar, PDFs)
- Export data in a PDF file

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React JS using Context API, and Apollo-Boost. Styles using Ant Design.

- Using a JavaScript library like React gave us a lot of flexibililty to incorpororate other packages for data visualization and gamification.
- We were able to create a Progressive Web App to avoid the environment issues that come with a native mobile app making the app more accessible to those even in areas with slower internet speeds or even those who are offline.
- We wanted our application build to be quick and scalable so we could focus on the features our users need.
- We implemented Context API with Apollo-Boost to handle our state and calls to the database.

#### [Front-end](https://www.moodbloomapp.com) deployed to Netlify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/ema-therapy-be) built using:

#### Node.js with Express, GraphQL, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

- We chose Node.js due to it's flexibility and quick set up.
- We decided to use GraphQL to query our database because it made setting up complex data shapes simpler.
- We implemented MongoDB with mongoose so we could switch our collections easily without having to alter tables or reset our database with each new version release.

# APIs

## Passport.js with OAuth

Everyone likes an easy sign up process. We chose to go with Passport.js because it allowed users to use their Google login to sign up in seconds and it was a lot easier for the dev team to set up and debug. We started out using Auth0 but quickly found that it wasn't meeting our needs.

## Apollo-Boost

This is a library that allows you to write your GraphQL queries directly in your code just like you would in the Graphiql playground. It's like Axios but made for GraphQL.

## Context API

Apollo-boost limits your global state management options and we found that Context API worked best with our tech stack.

## Ant Design

Our UX team went with Ant Design components in our UX file so we challenged ourselves to learn the design system.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY - this is your Open Weather API key, which can be generated at https://openweathermap.org/api.
    *  REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_KEY - Cloudinary upload preset key

# Testing

<strong>Front-end:</strong> React Testing Library with Jest
</br>
<strong>Back-end:</strong> Jest with Supertest

# Installation Instructions

Fork & clone both the front-end and back-end, run `yarn` and then `yarn start` on the front-end and `yarn server` on the back-end.
